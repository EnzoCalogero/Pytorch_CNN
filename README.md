# PyTorch_CNN
The project aims to build a classifier for the visual dataset 
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

The classifier based on CNN is implemented with the Python library torch.

The project is based of two steps.

1. Identify the architecture and the weights for a working and usable classifier. (all the steps are described on the Jupiter notebook “image Classifier Project.ipynb”

2. Create a script were the model can be used to classify the type of flowers from a given image.
